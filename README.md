# ðŸ§  AI-Driven Medical Image Analysis for Sports Injury Diagnosis and Prevention

## Overview

This repository presents an innovative AI-driven framework designed to enhance the **diagnosis, prevention**, and **rehabilitation** of sports-related injuries. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual interpretation of medical imaging and biomechanical data, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent. Our proposed solution integrates **deep learning**, **biomechanical modeling**, and **adaptive decision-making** to enable precise and real-time injury management.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Biomechanically-Informed Neural Network (BINN)**  
  BINN utilizes convolutional and recurrent neural networks with self-attention mechanisms to analyze kinematic, physiological, and performance data. It extracts meaningful biomechanical patterns that inform injury risk prediction and movement efficiency analysis.

- **Adaptive Sports Medicine Strategy (ASMS)**  
  A dynamic system that continuously updates injury risk assessments and rehabilitation strategies using real-time data. ASMS ensures timely and personalized intervention planning.

- **Multimodal Data Fusion**  
  Combines motion capture, medical imaging, and physiological data to improve accuracy and contextual understanding.

- **Real-Time Feedback for Athletes**  
  Enables ongoing monitoring and individualized recommendations throughout training and recovery phases.
